# Support-Vector-Machine-in-AMPL

The goal of this project is to implement the primal and dual quadratic formulations of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier with AMPL. As studied in class, the SVM classifier aims to find two parallel hyperplanes so that they can separate points of two different classes; as well as maximising the distance between these two hyperplanes and minimising the classification error.

The SVM will be applied to the generated dataset *gensvmdat* and to the diabetes dataset found in a OpenML repository mentioned in the references. For both these linearly separable datasets, the primal and dual problems will be implemented; as well as for a linearly nonseparable dataset which will also be implemented with a RBF or Gaussian kernel.
